### Metatags
Sure, technically all tags are metadata, but I'm classifying metadata tags as such for a special reason. For me, I manage my Zettels with lots and lots of tags, but for the most part, I only apply tags to the most fundamental and central note per cluster. So what about data that I need to include in every note for ease of filtering? For example: daily journal entries or notes that refer to note-taking ( hence the "Metatags" term) are common as things that are best filtered *out* of your Obsidian graph. For these, I have a new solution: Metatags! To create a metatag with Nucleus, simply prefix your tag name with a `-` character. #-meta and #-dated-entry are just a couple examples.

What's the point of the distinction, you ask? Adding the dash separates them from the rest of the name-space, which means it leaves the #meta tag, for example, open for use! This way it's easy to distinguish which tags are in fact metatags and which tags aren't. Metatags appear green to distinguish them further but I also think it just looks really nice that way.

### Use
To install Nucleus:
 - Download the latest release
 - Drop the `obsidian.css` file into your vault directory (save a backup of your current theme if necessary)
 - Make sure that custom CSS is enabled in your appearance settings.
